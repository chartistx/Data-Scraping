Scrapers were made in 2019

This folder contains web sraping scripts using selenium.
Scraping scripts were made for multiple broker webpages.

After each update in data file a copy is made in Metatrader folder in location where 
indicator reads data from so that it may be displayed in application.

OANDA scraper requires username and password inserted in code.

CodeLocus_OANDA_sentiment.mq5 is code example used in MetaTrader5 platform that reads data from
local repository where scraping script saves a copy after each update.

Scraper and  MT5 indicator can work simultaneously.
